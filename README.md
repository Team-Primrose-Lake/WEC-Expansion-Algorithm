# WEC-Expansion-Algorithm
The goal of this algorithm is to optimise the placements of each fire hall that has a raidus of 2.5km. The placements of the fire halls cannot be moved as the area expands.



Set parameters:
  - Fire hall circles must cover the entire non-uniform area
  - Able overlap with eachother
